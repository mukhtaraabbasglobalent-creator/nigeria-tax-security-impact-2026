## Overview

This repository contains an independent, research-driven, and simulated assessment of
Nigeria’s digital tax systems, focusing on cybersecurity risks and individual tax impact analysis
under recent fiscal reforms.

The project is designed as a **professional portfolio artifact** demonstrating how cybersecurity,
digital governance, and policy awareness intersect in public-sector systems.

All security-related activities described in this repository are **strictly simulated** and conducted
in controlled, non-production contexts.  
**No live government systems were accessed, tested, or interfered with.**
